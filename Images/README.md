In this Directory you will find three files:
- **ESP32 Board Layout**: Board used in this example. It may differ from your option, however in the case of the SPI bus, the ports will not changed because these pins are standard for the ESP32. Other GPIOs might differ.
- **protoboard_layout**: Wires and componentes used in this example. Designed using fritzing [availale here](https://fritzing.org)
- **esp32_mrfc522_fritzing**: File created in fritzing for this project.
